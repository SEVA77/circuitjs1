# CircuitJS1 Desktop Mod

**Circuit Simulator is renamed CircuitJS1 Desktop Mod**

![](https://my77thblog.pp.ua/images/PROJECTS/circuit-simulator/circuitjs1-1-2-3-en.png)

The source code for offline version of the **Circuit Simulator** based on [NW.js](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js). It was originally written by Paul Falstad as a Java Applet. It was adapted by Iain Sharp to run in the browser using GWT. The program was compiled to offline version for Windows (x32, x64), Linux (x32, x64) and MacOS (x64) by Usevalad Khatkevich.

This program is distributed by me as a program for education. It is not recommended to use the program for modeling real circuits, since many components in the program are idealized.

The program supports the following languages: English, Russian, Danish, German, Polish, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Czech, Norwegian, Chinese.

For a web version of the application see:

## Downloads:

You can download this program for Windows (x32, x64), Linux (x32, x64) and Mac OS X (x64):
- [Latest release](https://github.com/SEVA77/circuitjs1/releases/latest)
- [All Releases](https://github.com/SEVA77/circuitjs1/releases)

> If you have problems with this application, you can try to use [this offline application of the main developer](http://www.falstad.com/circuit/offline/) based on Electron.

## Building the program

The tools you will need to build the project are:

* JDK 8+
* Maven 3+
* [Web2Executable](https://github.com/jyapayne/Web2Executable) or [nw-builder](https://github.com/nwutils/nw-builder) (more preferably)

Simply run `mvn clean install` from the circuitjs1 directory to build the project. Project directory after compilation for further building or debugging: `target/site`

After compiling the web application, you can then compile it into the local executables for a variety of platforms with the help of NW.js. To build this program on NW.js you will need a [Web2Executable](https://github.com/jyapayne/Web2Executable) or [nw-builder](https://github.com/nwutils/nw-builder). Command to compile the program via nw-builder:

```
nwbuild --glob=false target/site
```

## Development

For development run devmode:

```
mvn gwt:devmode
```

Devmode works directly in the `war` directory separate from the `target/site` directory.
