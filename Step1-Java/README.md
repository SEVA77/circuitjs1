# Step 1 - Work with Java

This folder contains files that supplement the source code in the https://github.com/sharpie7/circuitjs1 repository for the desktop version of the program.

I also added an archive with the source code from the repository https://github.com/sharpie7/circuitjs1 to this folder so that this repository could fully comply with the conditions of GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2 (3.a)
